These are important instructions to run Tests for this whole setup.

This current directory contains multiple files (new_user, user, admin.txt, login_users.txt, test_server.py, user.txt).
These files are necessary for running tests.

Please make sure to just keep the files which are extracted as they are.


*************
If your going to run these tests for "SECOND TIME" just make sure to delete folder present in "user" directory with name "folder1" along with
text file with name "file.txt".
